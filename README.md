# Hey, I’m Igor 👋

I’m a full stack software engineer with a strong interest in internal tools, developer experience, and solving real-world problems through pragmatic engineering. I care deeply about accessibility, inclusion, and making tech better for everyone — both behind the screen and in front of it.

- 🔭 Currently working on comsen and experimenting with a learning platform / tech school using the YouTube API.
- 🌱 Learning more about Go, LLMs & datasets, AI infrastructure (local/cloud), databases (MongoDB/Postgres), and deployment pipelines (Docker, K8s, Helm, Flux).
- 💬 Autistic & ADHD — I care about neurodiversity in tech and advocate for better accessibility, support systems, and open conversations.

### What I’m doing now
	
- 💼 Working as a software consultant, internal tools builder. Previously a full stack engineer (React, Go, Retool, Postgres).
- 🧩 Focused on building and maintaining internal tooling, reviving legacy systems, and supporting non-technical teams with well-integrated platforms.
- ⚙️ Mostly working with JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Python, Go, GraphQL, Postgres, Docker, and automation workflows.

### A bit more about me

Before tech, I worked in retail, sales, and customer support — that foundation taught me how to work with people, understand needs quickly, and communicate clearly. I still carry that with me into every project I take on.

Ask me about…
- 🎮 Games: Diablo, Path of Exile, Destiny, Fallout, Skyrim, indies like Hades and Stardew Valley.
- ⌨️ Side projects: Raspberry Pis, mechanical keyboards, app ideas, weird hardware.
- 🎹 Music: jazz, synthwave, and the occasional late-night jam on a MIDI keyboard.
