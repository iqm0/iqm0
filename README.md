- 💼 Currently I work for Apple Pay in the Business and Technical Development team.

- 📙 I have learned my Front End skills from the Responsive Web Development and JavaScript paths on FreeCodeCamp. 
- 📖 I have a couple ongoing projects on web automation and JAMstack development.
- 🌱 I am currently studying a few eDX courses from HarvardX, such as CS50, CS50W and TinyML.
- ⚛️ I am also still following and covering the FreeCodeCamp lessons, currently going through React JS.

- 💬 Ask me about:
- 🕹 Games: I like looter-shooters (Destiny, Division) and RPGs, but I play a bit of everything;
- ⌨️ Ideas for Raspberry Pi projects, such as the IOTstack;
- 🎹 Jazz and synthwave music, used to play a lot but nowadays I do a lot more listening;
