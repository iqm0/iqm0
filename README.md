💬 Things to ask me about:
- 🕹 Games: I am a longtime Diablo fan. I also like looter-shooters (Destiny, Division) and RPGs (Fallout, Skyrim), but I play a bit of everything (and indie games too, like Hades and Stardew Valley);
- ⌨️ Hit me up with ideas for app projects, fiddling with Raspberry Pis and small SoCs, Mechanical Keyboards...
- 🎹 Jazz and synthwave music. I used to play a lot back in my 20s, but nowadays it is mostly listening - still occasionally playing around with my MIDI controller in Ableton;
