### Hey, I'm Igor 👋

<br /> I am a web developer, going deeper with JavaScript, Python, Automation and Machine Learning to become Full Stack. 

- 💼 Currently I work for Apple Pay in the Business and Technical Development team.
- 📖 My focus is Front End Development, mainly JavaScript, React, JAMstack, Python, GraphQL, Gatsby, SCSS and Selenium.
- 💪 My background and work experience was centered around customer service and sales. I really enjoy helping other people.

- 💬 Ask me about:
- 🕹 Games: I am a huge Diablo fan and like looter-shooters (Destiny, Division), but I play a bit of everything (and indie games too);
- ⌨️ Ideas for app projects, fiddling with Raspberry Pis and small SoCs, Mechanical Keyboards...
- 🎹 Jazz and synthwave music. I used to play a lot back in my 20s, but nowadays it is mostly listening;

- 😊 Pronouns: he, him, his.
- From 🇧🇷 but moved to 🇬🇧 about 12 years ago.
